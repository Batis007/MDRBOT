Batista, E.; Lopes, A.; Alves, A. What Do We Know about Botryosphaeriaceae? An Overview of a Worldwide Cured Dataset. Forests 2021, 12, 313. https://doi.org/10.3390/f12030313 

Botryosphaeriaceae-related diseases occur worldwide in a wide variety of plant hosts. Studies targeting the distribution, diversity, ecology, and pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae species are consistently increasing. However, with the lack of consistency on species delimitation, name of host or location among studies it is almost impossible to quantify the presence of these species worldwide, or the number of different host-fungus interactions. In this review we collected and organized Botryosphaeriaceae occurrences in a single cured dataset, allowing for the first time a complete perspective on species global diversity, dispersion, host association, ecological niches, pathogenicity and communication efficiency of new occurrences and new host-fungus associations. This dataset is freely available through an interactive and online application. The current release (version 1.0) contains 14405 cured isolates and 2989 literature references of 12121 different host-fungus interactions with 1692 different plant species from 149 countries.
